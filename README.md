## Predicting Survival Based on Echocardiogram Measurements and Results

In the course for Data Mining, my final capstone project was utilizing a dataset to determine survival after a heart attack based upon Echocardiogram measurements and characteristics.  Heart disease is generally caused by cholesterol build-up in the coronary arteries.  After a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, where blood supply is interrupted to the heart tissue, death of heart tissue can occur.  Sometimes this damage is reversible, other times it is irreversible.  An echocardiogram or heart ultrasound can show the anatomy of the heart as well as other findings which could impact long-term survival.

This dataset was obtained from the University of California-Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  In the subjects of this dataset, an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) was done and measurements taken from those who suffered a heart attack.  The target variable was survival 1 year after the heart attack.  The purpose of this project was to use a machine learning algorithm to see if survival could be accurately predicted based on the measurements variables in question.
